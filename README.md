# e_commerce_assignment_1182226
I have identified three core resources for e_commerce: 1)category 2)customer 3)order.#
For each one I have added a controller, dto, entity, repository, and a service. 
An exception package was also added, classifying the exceptions into two main types namely: BadRequestException, ResourceNotFoundexception.
A table showing the api design for the first two resources can be found in the repository with the name "APIDesign", the third resource is missing due to an unresolvable error. 
APIs were created for the resources, tested using Postman, the data gets edited and the edits were verified. 
A database was also created with docker. An image was created as well.
